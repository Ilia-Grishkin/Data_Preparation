    "I see three approaches for further data preparation process:\n",
    "1. Identify features which contain foreign keys, format them as a string and treat them as a string values such as ID. It will allow us to do EDA and analyses. Additionally this approach will save time for operations, memory and computing power. However there may be a problem with quality of our EDA and with a futher interpritation. For example, the column \"Marital status\" may contain more foreign keys than stored in dictionary. In this case we can end up with situation where we included missing values. It can affect our preparation and analysis.\n",
    "2. Merging datasets. Substitute foreign keys with their definitions. It will allow us to identify missing values even if cells contain values. For example, if the column \"Marital status\" will contain single numerical values after merging we will be able to assign them as \"Unknown\" category. However, the size of the file with database will grow, with means more memory, computing power and time for code to run will be spent.\n",
    "3. Mixed approach. Technically, we can merge data, make a data preparation proccess. And after devide data back. This apporoach may be helpful if we want to save resourses and perform proper preparation process. However, this method requires many manipulations with data. I think this method make sense when potential resources which may be saved are significantly higher than resourses which analyst spends for that."
